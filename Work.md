###  	Automation of nuclear material cladding coating measurement process

This project began as a solution to the time-intensive manual labeling of microscopy images during my work at the Nuclear Research Institute in Řež. I later expanded it into the focus of my bachelor’s thesis. The core objective was to semi-automate the institute’s coating analysis workflow by integrating a trained U-Net model into their existing process.

A major part of the work involved building a custom dataset from scratch, as no suitable dataset previously existed. The training process, model architecture, and dataset creation are all thoroughly documented in the thesis.

### Nanoindent growth measurements web app

This Python-based project focuses on processing image pairs—typically “before” and “after” shots—to analyze changes in a grid-like structure. It calculates the elongation and width differences of grid elements between the two images, providing insights into material deformation. The final work was integrated into a web-app.

The project was developed as part of my work at the Nuclear Research Institute in Řež and aims to assist in nanoindentation experiments through automated analysis.

### Computational Chemistry – Racemization of n-Helicenes

I worked on the racemization properties of several helicenes, including <b>pentahelicene</b>, <b>hexahelicene</b>, <b>heptahelicene</b>, and <b>dinaphtho[5]helicene</b>. My research focused on calculating <b>racemization barriers</b>, identifying <b>transition states</b>, and analyzing <b>IR spectra</b>.

Along the way, I gained experience with tools like <b>Gaussian</b>, <b>VMD</b>, <b>Avogadro</b>, <b>ModRefiner</b>, and <b>QuantumATK</b> for molecular modeling and simulation.
